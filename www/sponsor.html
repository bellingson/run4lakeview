        <h2>4th Annual</h2>
<h1>Run 4 Lakeview 5K and Kids Run</h1>

<h3>Would you like to help a child, without the financial resources to afford it, be able to play hockey?</h3>


<p>The original 5K Run 4 Lakeview and 1 mile youth run was held on Saturday, October 1, 2016 as part of the kick off celebration for Marquette’s Hockeyville designation. This race has now transitioned to focusing on allowing more kids the opportunity to play the sport that this community loves.   All proceeds from this event now goes to the Marquette Junior Hockey Financial Assistance Program.  This fund set up through Marquette Junior Hockey allows children, who wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford it, to receive funds for registration and playing fees for the program.</p>


<p>Currently, we are looking for sponsors to assist in continuing to put on this great event.  Attached you will find sponsorship opportunities.  The race will take place on Saturday, September 28th at 10am.  It starts and finishes at Lakeview Arena.   You can also visit our website for more information in regard to the event:  Run4lakeview.com 
Please help support the great sport of hockey in our Marquette community and runners/walkers as they participate in this health promotion event!  We encourage you to like our facebook page and would love to see yourself and your employees participate in this great event.</p>

        <h1>Do you want to be part of something great?</h1>


<p>Marquette’s Lakeview Arena was recently recognized as the winner of Kraft Hockeyville USA for 2016.  This competition took place over several months and included 3 rounds of online voting.  During this time our local community rallied behind the rink, while gaining state and national support along the way.   The support was overwhelming, with tens of thousands of people voting.</p>  


<p>Throughout the period of October 1-4, 2016, Friends of Lakeview Arena (a 501c3 foundation) will be putting on a community celebration, culminating with an NHL preseason hockey game between the Buffalo Sabres and Carolina Hurricanes at Lakeview Arena on Tuesday October 4th.   The Kickoff event for this 4 day celebration will be the Hockeyville 5K Run 4 Lakeview on Saturday, October 1, 2016.   There will also be a 1 mile youth run. </p>

<p>The excitement surrounding this 4 day celebration will be tremendous.   Social media, news and radio coverage will be huge in promotion and coverage of the events.  The race start and finish celebration will take place at Lakeview Arena, with a live radio feed during the event.  We are anticipating 500 participants, as well hundreds of spectators and volunteers.  
  Currently, we are looking for sponsors to assist in putting on this great event.  All proceeds from this event will go towards upgrades at Lakeview Arena. </p>


<p>Please help support Lakeview arena and hundreds of runners/walkers as they participate in this health promotion event!
